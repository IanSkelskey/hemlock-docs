# Privacy Policy

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and protect your information.

## Reason for Collection
The App uses Firebase Analytics, a service provided by Google, to collect
anonymous usage data, such as screen views, events, and user
interactions. This information is used to analyze app usage patterns,
improve user experience, and prioritize features.

In the event of a crash, a stack trace is collected, along with the
make and model of the device, and some logs about the network requests
made by the app leading up to the crash. This information is used to
fix bugs and improve app stability.

## Personal Data Collected
- Installation UUID
- IP address - once received it is geo-coded to a country and displayed on a map. Retained temporarily.
